# CRUD API project 

- I got a server, giving me a list of movies from the DB
- I must have the following routes -> functions -> endpoints -> methods:
    - GET ALL -> getMoviews -> /movies -> GET
    - GET BY ID -> getMovie -> /movies/{id} -> GET
    - CREATE -> createMovie -> /movies -> POST
    - UPDATE -> updateMovie -> /movies/{id} -> PUT
    - DELETE -> deleteMovie -> /movies/{id} -> DELETE

POSTMAN is used for testing the API
